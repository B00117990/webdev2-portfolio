<p>This is the Design Process and Practice page. Here, you can find a collection of sketches and my finalised poster for the first assignment of this module. The sketches were all done by hand with references in my sketchbook dedicated to this module. I came up with these sketches based on the common iamagery that was associated with the words "mental" and "heath".</p>
	
	<p>For my poster, I decided that I wanted to create something based on mental health. I have struggled with mental heath issues since I was young, but thankfully know how to cope with it due to this, but other people may have trouble coping, so that's why I dedicated my poster to this.</p>
	
	<p>I took one of the sketches I liked and took it into Adobe Illustrator; where I digitalised it and traced it and turned it into a poster.</p>
