	<p>This is the media page of my website!</p>
	
	<p>Here, you can find a variety of works I have done throughout my course that are media based works.</p>
	
	<p>For one of my assignments, I had to create a 3 minute video in a group! This meant finding actors, finding locations, organising shooting times, shooting the video over a period of time. And afterwards, we had to individually edit our videos and present them to our class and lecturer.</p>
	
	<p>For another one of my assignments, I had to create an interactive text based game on a site called Twine. Using variables, I made mine interactive by having items the character could pick up and use, and different outcomes depending on the relationship you build with the secondary character! </p>
