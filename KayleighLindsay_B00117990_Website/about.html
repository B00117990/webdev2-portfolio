	<p>My name is Kayleigh Lindsay!</p>
		
	<p>I am a 19 year old who lives in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
		
<p>I am a first year college student studying Creative Digital Media in the Technological University Dublin
Blanchardstown Campus. I picked this course as I have always been interested in creating- even as a
young child (I can recall very early memories of drawing), and I am also interested in the growing
technological world. I felt this course is a perfect harmony of the two; and would allow me to express
myself in multiple different platforms unlike other creative courses therefore I pursued it, and here I
am!</p>
		
<p>From the ages of 10-14, I attended a local art and crafts club twice a week, where I got the chance to
express my creativity in front of my peers and to gain confidence in my work. I took Art from first to
third year in Secondary school, did it twice a week through the entirety of Transition Year, and took Art
History and Appreciation for my Leaving Certificate. I have won several art awards in my school,
including an end of year Senior Award for art. Only one student between 4th-6th year gets this award! I
applied to a summer portfolio course in the National College of Art and Design and ended up getting a
	scholarship for it!</p>
		
<p>I am very passionate about arts and crafts.</p>
